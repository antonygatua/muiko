# My Portfolio

Before becoming a Data enthusiast and being facinated by Introduction to Databases, a unit in freshman year at campus, I really wanted to be a web developer.

Being passionate about data has made me shift my attention to data science and data engineering but I'm still a huge fun of web development. To practise my web skills, I decided to came up with this simple portfolio about me.

It contains brief decription about me, some of the articles I write once in a while, My Resume & just incase you want to contact me over Data Science, football, coffee, dogs,  travel, photography and so much more. 

I will try to make it as simple as possible and please feel free to give your feedback.

In a parallel universe, I'd love to be a photographer, nature film maker & Marine or Wildlife Biologist
